Ideas,Theme a,Theme-b,Theme-c,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5,Question,Answer
"1) Maximize the Beauty - fully channel the beauty with in. Maybe ask what makes this moment beautiful? See if beauty can be increased in every situation. MtB also could be taken as a use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds). (Update 3-16-21 -This is one of the first 4 points created because they were on the top of my mind when I first started this project. Maximize the Beauty and Full Expression still are some of the concepts I am most influenced by, create an ethos around, consider to be primary to my concept of virtue, and aim to implement as much as possible.) ",fun,rational,positive,personal,"theme ideas - rough, rational, intuitive, positive , neutral, negative, fun, deep, chill, relational, inspiring, spicy, sexy, neech, opinion, philosophical, personal, stoic, deluze vibes, buddha, yoga boiii, emotion",,
"2) Full Expression - it takes a lot of effort for one to understand who they are when they are comfortable and how to channel the most real expressions of themselves what holds people back? Shyness, distraction (inability to focus on that which they want express)",inspiring,intuitive,positive,personal,"top 5 idea themes- rational, positive, inspiring, chill, intuitive",,
"3) Expect Rising - this means our expectations are constantly rising. Kind of in line with ""give em an inch they'll take a mile"" also related to law of diminishing returns -""The law of diminishing returns states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant (""ceteris paribus""), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns."" Tooo much ice cream too much cash",rational,negative,negative,,,,
"4) The Power of Pettiness - is the idea that pettiness is the destroyer of all people. That even the best of us can’t truly be unaffected by the petty bullshit around us. They can however minimize its effects. In my own life I am obliterated by friends and coworker’s snide remarks and judgments. How do I minimize its effects? By talking myself down, deep breaths, weed, alcohol, revenge...(this is the end of the first four points that were the strongest when I first started making these ideas on a small scrap of paper from the sides on union film sets.)",chill,inspiring,positive,,,,
5) Various meditation - I am a big fan of meditation techniques that help train the mind from moment to moment. There are various techniques that help provide concentration and awareness in the passing moments within shorter intervals than traditional formal meditation. While using a timer to make sure you meditate for at least 10 minutes is helpful. A stopwatch to monitor your awareness of time and to also use time to monitor your concentration and awareness. A and C are essential to have Full Expression. Update 2-26-19 - Passive observation ala Krishnamurti. Just chill. Dont do anything. Just observe whatever is present. Don't react to thoughts just observe them. Don't interact with them. If they are mind blowing write them down. Then return to just chilling and observing.,chill,fun,inspiring,,,,
"6) tolerance - while it seems like an easy point to rally behind, the reality anyone that reads Nietzsche would think otherwise. By tolerating mild forms of exploitation we soon begin to think if we are encroaching upon the slave mentality Nietzsche is so against. I find myself tolerating crappy food, living conditions, jobs, and relationships. Is there a reward for this or am I just making my life mediocre?",intense,inspiring,fun,,,,
"7) - intention vs. non intention - Buddha says our intentions matter most when determining the value of an action while Neech says the opposite. Specifically, that we have our intentions but what comes out of that is the real meat of an action. Good example is my recent heart torturing break up. Nothing was intended to be so terrible but the reality was very painful for me. Thus judge me for letting tragedy strike me when I could have protected myself by 1) giving myself space 2) being aware of the possibilities of the situation better",rational,spicy,hot,,,,
8) - Neech real/dumb - Nietzsche had some great points and spoke without fear of repercussion. His ideas still are challenging us today. But his manner of demeaning women and Jews is just dumb. Also needlessly ambiguous over just how much he dislikes Jews. His dislike of women seems pretty clear but I bet he had some hope too.,negative,spicy,neech,opinion,phil ,,
"9) - Camus - beautiful not pragmatic - I love the fall and just the general vibe of Camus. In my opinion the fall is the best combination of fiction and philosophy ever written. For a while I loved Camus like no other but as of recent I’m kind of annoyed by his concept of absurdism. It’s like ""yeah bro sure...life is absurd but is that the best way to describe life?"" In general existentialist thought seems to discount the need for pragmatic thought in most of the situations we encounter.",opinion,rational,neutral,opinion ,phil ,,
10) - pragmatism in absolutes too much variability- Pragmatism is in a way the Buddhism of western philosophy in that it aims at smaller goals and ideas chiefly. Getting deeper pragmatically - philosophy of science - best practices - ideas that lose the weight of hard science and the loftiness of philosophy.,rational,phil,fun,,,,
"11) - complexity - avoid decision --> in a way it’s better to just do nothing and avoid any of the consequences that come from failure to appropriately analyze complex decisions. The complexity I am interested in is that which involves morality, love, health, and satisfaction.",rational,phil ,inspiring,opinion,,,
12) - Foucault - Silence /friends - Foucault talks about the different types of silences. Harsh vs. pleasant silences that extend throughout the day between friends. More on friends later. Update 2-20-19 – I really want to have more silent hangs. That feeling of intimacy without having to speak. Intimacy that is platonic too.,positive,phil,inspiring,,,,
13) - Religion - no dogma - man - i.e. - complexity makes religion seem so terrifying. Which one to choose! Oh god! I actually respect all religions and their traditions. Maybe from the idea that they all are some elaborate form of performance art.,art,religious,opinion,,,,
14) Buddhism - a) life is pleasant - most of the time really - gawd don’t be such a hater Buddha B) lets blaze - one of the few religions to be so explicitly anti- weed tho they all seem to be,religious,fun,opinion,,,,
15) run dork run - be free - let all your weirdness come out - full expression might just make all your awkward traits beautiful,positive ,phil ,fun,,,,
"16) games – Be a good lil sociopath path and self-monitor as they say “fake it b4 u make it"" - so much is a game, but it’s usually played with people we are not so close to, so maybe we can transcend games but the give and take of life seems so entrenched... to see how you can improve your self-monitoring consult Snyder’s guide to self-monitoring (SELF-MONITORING SCALE by Mark Snyder (1974)) Self – Monitor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring Snyder’s scale - http://faculty.washington.edu/janegf/selfmonitoring.htm Sociopath – be a good sociopath",rough,spicy,emotion,rational,inspiring,,
17)games - hold back - don’t show your cards - don’t invest all you can - always hold back a little - in a way this may really help you preserve some mental health and buoyancy,rational,spicy,rough,emotion,,,
"18) don’t step on any buddy’s toes - contrasting with Nietzsche's will to power - this idea says you can get yours with your strong will but don’t fuck over others in the process, especially those close to you. Hard to always follow.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
19) take chances -> shit where you eat - the babes we like are often those that hang with our friends. The people we do business with are often are friends. Relats n biz get ugly often but sometimes you can’t avoid shitting where you eat.,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
20) Nietzsche - will to power - exert it - dominate - within bounds - i.e. git it! But don’t step on toes but do be a force a leader - maybe even just don’t look back at the path of destruction caused in creating something that will put u in a much better place in some or many ways,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
21) talk to yourself - rap to yourself - sing to yourself - write to yourself - think to yourself - make your mind as healthy and flexible as possible - this weird interior dialogue may help,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
22) everyone has a void - i.e. - a hole - satisfaction is hard to come by don’t feel bad that you feel bad,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
23) down with meditation - any form - almost every form is helpful - 5 - talks about forms made up - but goals and processes of different meditation are helpful in their own ways,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
24) gotta git up to git down - concentration can help awareness - shit can be the recipe for success,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
25) animal/ vegetable astrology - essences abound in both - learn from the physical characteristics of nature,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
26) psycho vs. socio path - ones more productive - both are cray,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
27) paradox with in - complexity with in is tantamount to paradoxical traits and incongruent behavior is the norm,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
28) heaven -> no need to speculate - jah is I... Live it love it ... Worry after,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"29) time - don’t be afraid - watch it pass - measure it with stopwatches, clocks, calendars, timers - be intimate with time",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"30) feminism - gitty up! Update 2-19-19 Feminism is important to me because I see half the population of the world suffering from a patriarchical prejudice that is stunting the growth of civilization. If that’s not enough to be a feminist, I don’t know what is. Prejudice is inherently dumb. Patriarchy is a biased archaic system. Any ways I say gitty up because its little traveled territory for men to have a legit opinion on feminist issues, but if you see something say something, right? Taking the concept of full expression as an example of maximized beauty, we see its extreme importance in all of our lives. Older but mildly edited writing It’s about comfort to express fully - inequality runs deep - share your beautiful life grrrl! Be all you and that’s all you need to be satisfied… But for real tho sex positive feminism…. can’t say enough about it. You see in sexuality there’s a power of agenda (i.e. who sets the agenda is the powerful one). In that sense, feminist sexuality exists wherever women are controlling or have an equal role in the sexual agenda. I would also argue that feminist sexuality exists wherever women are satisfied with the sexual agenda or satisfied with their decision to engage in a sexual act even if they are totally lacking any control of the agenda. Update 2-19-19 – Is there a backlash against sex positivity in 2019? Could it be just a general distaste in men? Or could it be the influence of fascism in the world? Are we subtly acting more fascist towards how we approach sex?",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
31) Neech - Jews n Women -> why be such a dumbass Neech? Jews = king of the slaves Women = less than that even in Neech's mind Come on bro. Misogyny n anti-Semitism is so 1880's. Jews as Christians as lame moralists I’m down with tho. Women thing a lot harder to rally behind.,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"32) Buddha - Good on mental quals - One thing that I will always credit the Buddha with was his capacity to describe mental qualities. Jesus never really got too into the mental real, but the Buddha was all over it. Pliancy and all this listed below: tranquility of body, kaya-passaddhi tranquility of mind, citta-passaddhi lightness of cetasikas, kaya-lahuta Iightness of citta, citta-lahuta pliancy of cetasikas, kaya-muduta pliancy of citta, citta-muduta wieldiness of cetasikas, kaya-kammannata wieldiness of citta, citta-kammannata proficiency of cetasikas, kaya-pagunnata proficiency of citta, citta-pagunnata uprightness of cetasika kaya-ujukata uprightness of citta, citta-ujukata",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"33) Dreams - Live in a dream state - turn it on / off - Sometimes, when things suck its nice to just dream about nicer alternatives. Update -2-19-19 – Ive been sleeping in more. Recording more dreams. Adding more consciousness to my subconscious. No lucid dreaming recently, but lots of good vibes. Good vibes in general can be cultivated, just like consciousness of our dreams. Don’t believe? Im a fucking stoner. Half of believe, that that makes it harder to remember dreams. You can will yourself to remember dreams. You can will yourself to positivity, contentment, a dream-like existence, etc.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"34) Vocals - Feeling in Frailty- I love to sing with a frail sounding voice - shrill if you will. It adds to the emotional value of the song, also giving it a sense of the place where the emotions come from. Update -2-19-19 – Sense place – ie – more details on the singer’s unique tones + more context to the lyrics in the song",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"35) Dating - The Best: So BIOLOGICAL - • The worst: so distracting from the Higher Self Update -2-19-19 – Biological as in even more than productive psychological even more than symbiotic psychologically. Past psychological what is there? Biological symbiosis. Eating better together. Being more productive together, not because of something the other person says just like on level of existence that isn’t just some sort of everyday assistance. Sort of like the indescribability of love. Helping someone else in its purer forms is indescribably beneficial and beautiful. ",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"36) Higher - More Productive Healthier Self - The process of creating a symbiosis between productivity and health. There are times when we are living in a very productive want and also maintain great physical and mental health. Many associate this with a stable living situation, but what the idea that variety is the spice of life?",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"37) Conscious Orientation => LUSH (i.e. Love Understanding Satisfaction Health) - We can ask ourselves how can I be healthier in this moment? How can I understand the situation better? How can I be more satisfied right now? More satisfied with things this month? This year? In the next 3 years? How can I love myself, others, the Universe? It’s kinda some hippy shit I know, but let’s be realistic about things. Who doesn’t want a little more love in their life?",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
38) discipline => me =>test,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
39) abstain renunciate =>^ -interrelated concepts as abstinence requires discipline and to renunciate something is to demonstrate discipline,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"40) astrology - reverse it/ surrender - astrology doesn’t bind us to certain actions. In reality we can comfortably reverse our astrological preferences for large periods of time, but it’s also nice to surrender to our astrological charts to fully embrace any insights it may bring.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"41) concentration => Fux wit it -- we can measure the quality of our concentration, try to improve it with exercises, and generally experiment to understand its nuances.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"42) Speak: 1) intelligently 2) colloquially - these two ways of speaking will probably help you more than say speaking eloquently. Speaking colloquially will help you in the work place too as it is the speech of bullies and thieves i.e. your bosses. (this marks a new sheet of ideas that I worked usually called ""The First 42"")",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"43) Lack of Logic in Desire – Passions so inherently divergent from rational thought. The mind copes as desire explodes. Picking up the pieces in haunting dreams. (this marks a new sheet of ideas that I worked called ""42 points of Ideals and Terrors"")",rational,intuitive,fun,,,,
44 ) Lines- Ink Blot – Image – Feeling – Memory -> Simple Lines like an ink blot create images – feelings – memories – so much stronger and more complex than the simple blots and lines. This phenomena highlights the capacity of the brain to invent its own stories from the tiniest amounts of information. Just imagine the stories that get invented from the stories people tell us or the charged bits of information we are given.,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"45) Description of Grips, Bands, Roommates – I love all the unique features of the people that come into my life. Sort of like the spoon river anthology, I’d like to keep an up to date description of the people I work with, live with, and hang with at shows / parties.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"46) Satori – Barthes – Surprise -> Zen but what’s da real Zen? – Roland Barthes – in the “The Wisdom of Art” describes Cy Twombly’s art as invoking the Zen term Satori which translates as “surprise” – I don't know maybe all art theory seems a little inauthentic and reaching, but I kind of hated this essay and its description of satori. Wikipedia describes Satori like this: “Satori - is a Japanese Buddhist term for awakening, ""comprehension; understanding"". It is derived from the Japanese verb satoru. In the Zen Buddhist tradition, satori refers to the experience of kenshō, ""seeing into one's true nature"".” As seen by the god known as Wikipedia, Barthes may not be talking out of his ass but he is at least stretching this word out past its meaning to make some other meaning in writing that also just lacks feeling and authenticity.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"47) Never Impressed -> Death – Cept You: Especially in my daily life, I am never impressed. Maybe I am kinda impressed by people that are able to get slightly better than mediocre jobs and the kindness of others, but that feeling of “WOW!” never comes. :/ Except by all of you of course… ;) and especially not impressed when comparing the powerful impression that DEATH creates compared to the little blips on a giant screen that are the most impressive lives in human history. It’s like – “Hey what makes a more powerful impact on you, the terror of death or Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity?” Really there is no competition and no greater power over us than the fear of death / desire to survive. ",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
48) Never Surprised – Life is what it is. The dearth of morals I exhibit really isn’t that surprising nor is anything else. ,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"49) Satisfied – Frank Sinatra like Erin Prom Virginity off to College Ideals of Love<-- Romance & ageless Like Gramma Basement Dance Parties This Point is like 19 points – but it all surrounds Frank Sinatra Love and Satisfaction. First, there’s the ideals behind the music of Frank Sinatra which highlight a satisfaction with monogamous romantic love in all its ageless glory. I then give two anecdotes. The first is about my first real monogamous love Erin who I went to prom with, lost my virginity to, and continued to date my freshman year into my sophomore year. There was an agelessness to our senior prom that inspires me to love that moment in time to this day. The prom photos help. Also that time connects to the story my grandma told me about her friends dancing in their basement to these songs from the who knows when, but obviously from the 20’s to mid-40s would be my guess. All of this points to the ideals of love which state: a) Love involves the romantic events that truly fulfill us. b) The emotion of romantic love provides true satisfaction. c) Loving relationships are the poetry of human interactions. Affection as a deeper human beauty. ",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"50) The Inaccessibility of the Real  à Baudrillard à Does it matter if its so far? Baudrillard  in “simulacra…” states that the real is so far away from us in this present age and that every thing is more like simulacra of simulations of the real. My point is this: “Who Cares?” We can rage against the falsity of our age or we can just accept it and not think about it, but also, with so few caring about this issue one has to wonder should the few of us that do care even bother wasting our time. Well…I’ll just say after reading that whole book and really enjoying the part about the falsity of Disney World that Baudrillard is the man and it is important to cut out the bullshit, which is all the fakeness that exists in corporate America and our shitty political system.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"51) IE – All ABRSTRACTION – YES, Most don’t care and that’s important -> then What? -> Does it matter?Anything abstract is so forgotten. Forget blue vs white collar or Smart vs Dumb. The world of abstraction is the world of the .001%. So while it is the life blood of that .001%, its also not necessary to many others existing on a more intuitive level. Also people try to get shit right in their abstract minds while others just see their lives in this world more clearly and settle in to that life and the bullshit that plauges it as a tick settles into something that would likely like to kill it. Kinda like us and nature.",intuitive,fun,inspiring,,,,
"52) Death -> Does it matter?-> its certainty - mainly boresJust as the love of a steady lover, is accepted and forgotten, so too, is the horrifying terror of death. So then do we make decisions based upon death or love? Or do we make decisions based on more immediate concerns like “will it suck for me tomorrow if I do this?”",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"53) Sibylle B Best because more melodically original more genuine than Bobby D Obviously she wasn’t as prolific. Nor did she have the intellectual depth or descriptive beauty, but her melodies are haunting as is her vibe in general. Never releasing music on her own that was so amazing. There’s a realness to that. It’s like “These songs are mine and help me. I am content with that. Sorry world. No hard feelings. Much Love, Sibylle Baier.”",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"54) Inability to step Back -> Why? 1) Delusion -> No/too much feelings 2) Subj - NYC clouds the mind. Imprisons you in never ending concrete with a couple flimsy tree scattered about. Imprisons you with high rents. Imprisons you with culture that distracts you from your own cultural self. Imprisons you with cultivated personalities challenging and distracting you from your own archetypes to be developed and cared for. All of this makes stepping back and smelling the roses sunk in your skin so dificil. Hurrying about never able to ask “why don’t I feel worse about being so self-obsessed?” “Why don’t I feel better about being a genuinely open and available person?” Lastly, these questions are needed but how can you be sure about the answers when everything is so damn subjective???? I have no answers.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"55) What is the whole picture? -> Subj can’t agree on what it is Subjectivity revisited. So considering it’s so hard to step back. Take that applied to the idea of the whole picture. The big picture. So close staring at a part of the picture. Stepping back. What does that mean? The whole picture, what is that? What is it composed of? Love, Understanding, Satisfaction, Health, maybe?",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"56) Nature – Slut, Whore, Maniac - Sluts love nature. Whores make love in nature. Maniacs rub their vaginas all over the soil and stick their pee pees in beehives. At some point you get too close to nature.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
57) Minimize the things I hate the new plan - Pain is pleasure for masochists only. Pure pain should prolly be avoided if it’s not a whip or paddle. Avoid the terror of terrible people.,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"58) Meditation – Awareness of touch – do it all the time - Buddhism…meh. Meditation…YEH! Sorry to hate on the Buddhism but meditation needs to be separated from any religion and re-appropriated into the realm of conscious activity where it can be described as a minimal mental effort to recognize mental activity. One form of mental activity is knowing when we are touching something. For example, yo butt on a seat. As long as the mind is split between the bull shit mental droll and this efforting to be simultaneously aware of another mental activity, some form of freedom from that locked in feeling of day to day existence can be had. Escape the tunnel vision.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"59) Dbags fucking w/ you -> They like puppies -> You an old dog - The power of pettiness aside (of that other set of 42 points), recognition of dbag tendencies should be the first bit of wisdom used to help overcome that petty bullshit created by dbags. For real tho, dbags can get to you. One has to be prepared for bullshit because it can be a bit tricky even in its most obviously recognizable forms. Why? Usually it’s created by those closest to us. I feel like something deeper can be said here, but maybe that’s for like collaboration with some other person. ",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"60) Meditation -> Softens the Horror“The horror”… in a cute way tho. Like as humans we get old suffer die all the time, right? What horror! Betrayal and such, etc, but meditation tho…really softens it. For example, here’s an example of my inner dialogue:“I want to be successful! Gawd Im lame. Im gonna die. Im gonna go bald. Im gonna break bones and be feable. Shit this inner dialogue suxxx. Why don’t I just count some breaths. Breath in….Breath out….one… Breath in….Breath out….two…. Breath in….Breath out….three.” --> Horror softened.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"61) Booze -> spices up the horror In the sense that ya know like even tho you can die at any moment life still can be boring. So why not booze it up to see what happens. Booze is that spice. As its affects are varied. Drink too little maybe it will just make you tired. Brink just enough to get a nice buzz you will feel great! Drink to the brink of blacking out, maybe you’ll be super sad or maybe you will be outrageously euphoric. Variety ya know it’s the…",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"62) Weed -> Coma and Fog 4 the horror Yeah I mean weed comas are a think and when you smoke errday a fog like coma can ensue, but much productivity can come from it sooo ya never know really. Also, weed can just make you chill and really not that foggy if you can keep it really moderate, so maybe I’m being a bit too harsh on the 420.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"63) LSD -> in the chilliest situation it could lead to serious insight…bra. For real tho, don’t let me get into my zone on LSD it could just be too much deep sacred activity.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
64) Endlessly Release Repeat (ERR w/ the Maximization of Beauty) - I can’t even say yo…but if I was to say…I’d release your beauty like a butterfly fluttering fragile its death so certain. Then repeat that same beauty repeating endlessly like those flapping wings. That’s to say that there are moments in time that just do that in our hearts anyways. There are people that just do that in our hearts every time we see them. Let the weight of that beauty crush you…again and again.,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"65) Fucking High School Errwhere - For real tho…that high school mentality it’s everywhere…you can’t escape it! This point may seem kinda basic at first, but think about it…Obama acting like a lil high school brat… the Dalai Llama acting like a freshmen. Get it? That shit is pervasive. The human condition is rattled with pettiness.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
66) 5/2_/15 – Another time - That is to say: “I’m not writing this shit like every day. It takes a lot of motivation to keep it up. Sometimes I put it down for a long time. Do people care about their own ideas?” I’d love to read other people’s ideas: /,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
67) Dream: Swimming to the Statue of Liberty - Yeah that was a dream. Wouldn’t that be gross tho? I do like the feeling of grossness and the gentle current of the Hudson and some nasty idea of what the smell or taste of the water could be like. EWWWWWW. So gross yet so full of energy. The shock to the senses would be so enormous. Update 2-19-19 – Wait did I really advocate for this dreaming being pleasurable? It does seem to kind of stick in my brain tho.,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
68) Dreams – Live Porn - Cant remember this dream. No idea. Maybe like streaming live porn. Maybe like people doing it at like a shitty dive bar. You choose. Either way…who doesn’t like hearing about weird dreams?,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"69) Reset Percentage - I love this idea. It’s that we can find a base level. It’s that we can recover. It’s that no matter how shitty life is, there are things we can do to make up for the trauma we endure. It’s that we can feel our stress and feel our bodies trying to battle that stress. The basic idea is that at any given time we feel like we are in that like new feeling to a certain percentage. For example, if you are feeling totally refreshed and at your best you feel 100% reset.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
70) Title for this: “42 points of Ideals and Terrors” or “Another 42 Ideas that I Struggle to Make Happen or That I Struggle to Make Not Happen”,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
71) Experiment with what satisfies - Like 4 example - Haikus – a great way to think -> Regimentally,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"72) Check in as Much as you can - Check to see if you are aware of whatever is buzzing in that cute brain of yours. Why? In the brain, you have senses tingling and thoughts firing, which is the real energy of life.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"73) The Joy of Sacrifice - Sacrificing things is really just adding other things, but doesn’t it feel good to stop doing something so you can increase the love you have for someone in such a solid way. Real sacrifice leading to an increase in real love to the degree that it seems to have scientific causality (i.e. science would be like, “yo Adam you gonna love the shit out of dis person if you sacrifice all these things that occupy yo time when you could be putting in that time to increase love, beauty, harmony, positivity, real feelings that make life worthwhile, and end the cycle of bullshit that seems to flow into your life, fo real, this is science talking to you, looking you dead in the eye, straight up, not lying, and you know that, cause I’m fucking science bitch and a female so I can use the term bitch.”",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"74) No Phone – Feeling Freer - Not sure…maybe I was in Canada….Maybe I was on a plaaaane…Maybe I was on a silent meditation retreat…maybe I had to poo and couldn’t wait to find my phone…Either way… Sensing freedom is pretty sweet. Being like “damn I’m feeling free as fuck right now that I’ve been blind folded, hands tied, and dropped off naked in the woods WITHOUT A PHONE. OMG NO PHONE! Having no phone in woods is really the thing that makes me feel free, not this new lease on life this psychotic ax murderer has given me by abandoning me here…for real…No phone woOOOOo!”",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
75) HUMILITY APOLOGIZES - Like be humble say sorry and then shut up for once in your life Adam…GAWD!,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"76) Working on Relationships - Like the ASAP Ferg song “Work” saying “puttin in WORK…Dayum she pop that pussy.."", But for real yo…relationships of all types take a bit of work. Whether it’s just checking in and saying hey or if it’s just trying to suck less…sometimes you gotta do stuff you might not want to just to keep a relationship strong.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"77) Root out Negativity - Like Missy Elliot says “Let me search it, put my thing down flip it and reverse it.” To root out negativity you gotta search for it in one way then put your thing down flip it and reverse it to really find that source of negativity and root it out…like really root it out.",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"78) Honor Vs. Pity (Neech) Honor vs. Pity. An idea brought up by Nietzsche, which states that pity is more on the end of useless and honor is more on the end of useful because honor comes from respect for someone whereas pity comes from viewing negativity associated with a person. So for me this is a bit of a tough concept to always understand because I imagine examples of the homeless (i.e. if you give someone money is that out of pity always??? I don’t think so because you just see that they have a lot of qualities you respect in them and give them some cash out of hope for that better side winning out, right?)",fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
79) Vanity – Totally fucking you over? Does being a vain ass lil bitty always fuck you over? I’m not even sure? ,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
80) 2 feel (love) – Draw (Love) – Be Think Speak Touch Breath Eat (Love) - Hoping to feel that thing people tend to view really highly (aka Love)...Then,fun,inspiring,rational,,,,
"81) X, Y Line Graph 4 All Things Like for example on the y line going vertical we got fun and on the x going we got productive. So like I’d probably rank higher in fun than productive whereas like book nerd Marcus is prolly a bit higher in Productivity. Hmmm there other ones too tho. Update 2-19-19 -> All my art is this now.

Nah… you really aren’t you just have cultivated a certain set of habits that you could change. Views that can change. Is there an inherent meaning to anything? Not really even sure we need to explore this concept, but if we look at nihilism as the total rejection of meaning in anything we can see that this sort of concept is kind of dumb. Like words have meaning bro. A priori type logic is real bro. What can we gain from thinking of words as signals to things that exist in some approximate form? Authenticity…warm glowy feelings from grasping onto something solid? So yeah that part 1. Part 2 gists – like maybe it’s the concept that we can get the gist of all things…maybe it’s the opposite of nihilism that there is a reason for why everything happens that is perfectly explainable because the reasons are based on things with meaning.

,,,,,,what is the overarching theme or message in this document?,"the document seems to be a collection of thoughts, ideas, and reflections on various philosophical, artistic, and personal topics. however, there doesn't appear to be a single overarching theme or message. it covers a wide range of subjects from existentialism to meditation, relationships, and personal growth."
,,,,,,"what is the significance of the ""42 points"" structure?","the ""42 points"" structure appears to be an attempt to organize and present different ideas or concepts in a succinct, numbered format. it's unclear why specifically 42 points, but it could be a reference to the famous ""answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything"" from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy."
,,,,,,how does the author view the relationship between art and life?,"the author seems to view art and life as deeply intertwined, suggesting that ""art [can be] in every aspect of your life"" and that everyday objects and activities can be approached with an artistic mindset (point 1). the author encourages making things more artistically beautiful in various aspects of life."
,,,,,,what is the author's perspective on love and relationships?,"the author appears to have a complex and multifaceted view of love and relationships. on one hand, the author recognizes the ideals and satisfaction of romantic love (point 7), but also acknowledges the distractions and challenges relationships can present (point 35). the author encourages working on relationships (point 34) and suggests that lovers should strive to be what their partner wants them to be (point 20)."
,,,,,,how does the author view concepts like nihilism and the meaning of life?,"the author appears intrigued by nihilism, suggesting to ""explore it"" (point 12) while acknowledging that true nihilism is rare. the author also ponders existential questions like the nature of the universe's expansion (point 3) and the power of death in shaping human perspectives (point 5). however, there doesn't seem to be a definitive stance on the meaning of life presented."
,,,,,,what is the author's perspective on various philosophical figures and their ideas?,"the author engages with the ideas of several philosophers, including nietzsche, camus, baudrillard, and buddha. the author seems to appreciate certain aspects of their philosophies, such as nietzsche's bold writing style (point 5) and buddha's descriptions of mental qualities (point 32). however, the author also critiques some of their ideas, like nietzsche's views on women and jews (points 8, 31) and camus's concept of absurdism (point 9)."
,,,,,,how does the author view the role of meditation and mindfulness practices?,"the author seems to be a proponent of meditation and mindfulness practices, suggesting various techniques (points 5, 16, 18) and highlighting the potential benefits, such as softening the ""horror"" of human existence (point 18) and cultivating awareness (point 30). however, the author also expresses some skepticism towards buddhism specifically (point 14)."
,,,,,,"what is the significance of the ""maximization of beauty"" concept mentioned throughout the document?","the ""maximization of beauty"" appears to be a recurring theme or goal for the author. it is mentioned in the very first point, which encourages fully channeling inner beauty and seeing how beauty can be increased in every situation. later, in point 22, the author suggests endlessly releasing and repeating beauty. this emphasis on maximizing and appreciating beauty seems to be a central guiding principle or aspiration for the author."
,,,,,,how does the author view the relationship between discipline and personal growth?,"the author appears to place significant importance on discipline as a means for personal growth and self-improvement. point 5 suggests feeling the urges suppressed in order to truly experience discipline, while point 39 links discipline to practices like abstinence and renunciation. additionally, the author advocates for experimenting with and improving concentration (point 41), which requires discipline."
,,,,,,what is the author's perspective on societal norms and conformity?,"the author seems to challenge societal norms and conformity in several instances. for example, point 23 suggests that a ""high school mentality"" is pervasive in society, implying a certain level of pettiness and immaturity. the author also encourages resisting repercussions (point 15) and embracing one's ""weirdness"" through full expression (point 15). additionally, the author advocates for exploring nihilism (point 12), which could be seen as a rejection of conventional values and beliefs."
,,,,,,how does the author view the concepts of subjectivity and perspective?,"the author acknowledges the subjective nature of human experience and the difficulty in agreeing on a single, objective ""whole picture"" (points 12, 13). the author seems to embrace this subjectivity, suggesting that stepping back and gaining perspective can be challenging due to the inherent subjectivity of our experiences (point 12). additionally, the author recognizes that certain abstract concepts may be irrelevant or unimportant to many people existing on a more intuitive level (point 9)."
,,,,,,how does the author view self-awareness and introspection?,"the author seems to place a lot of value on self-awareness and introspection. several points emphasize practices like talking/writing to oneself (point 21), checking in on one's awareness frequently (point 30), and engaging in inner dialogue (point 18 example). the author also advocates feeling and experiencing urges/emotions as a path to greater self-understanding (point 5)."
,,,,,,"what is the significance of the ""full expression"" concept mentioned?","the concept of ""full expression"" appears to be about authentically and freely expressing one's true self without restraint. point 2 states ""it takes a lot of effort for one to understand who they are when they are comfortable and how to channel the most real expressions of themselves."""
,,,,,,how does the author approach the idea of satisfaction versus health?,"the author suggests there is a ratio or balance to consider between satisfaction and health (point 9). while satisfaction is desirable, the author implies one shouldn't completely sacrifice health to attain satisfaction, framing it as ""that middle-ish - moderate-ish way of life."""
,,,,,,"what is the author's perspective on success, achievement and ""winning""?","the author seems to place value on success and achievement, encouraging the reader to ""win!!! you deserve it!!!""

,,,,,,how does the author view nature and humanity's relationship to it?,"the author appears to have a complex perspective on nature. on one hand, there is a sense of reverence and connection, suggesting to learn from nature's essence (point 25). on the other extreme, point 14 humorously warns ""at some point you get too close to nature"" when discussing intimacy with nature."
,,,,,,what does the author suggest about belief systems and organized religion?,"while not explicitly rejecting religion altogether, the author expresses some criticism, such as buddhism being too anti-weed (point 14) and ""complexity makes religion seem so terrifying"" with the implication of difficulty choosing one (point 13). however, the author does respect religious traditions as potentially ""elaborate forms of performance art"" (point 13)."
,,,,,,how does the author approach the idea of consequences?,"the author emphasizes the inevitability of consequences multiple times, such as point 15 which states ""u don't live in a world free of repurcussions"" repeated five times for emphasis. this suggests the author believes it's important to recognize that actions have real consequences that cannot be avoided."
,,,,,,"what is the significance of references to specific artists, musicians, etc.?","the author makes several references to particular artists, musicians and their works, such as nietzsche, camus, baudrillard, frank sinatra, bobby d, and sybille baier. this suggests the author finds meaning, relevance or inspiration in analyzing the works and perspectives of various artists/creative figures."

,,,,,,what is the author's perspective on science and scientific concepts?,"the author appears to have a fascination and appreciation for various scientific topics and concepts. this is evident in the discussion of particle physics (point 2), the expanding universe (point 3), and references to concepts like psychophysics (point 5). the author seems intrigued by the profound questions science can raise about the nature of existence."
,,,,,,"how does the author view the concept of ""the real"" and authenticity?","the author seems intrigued by baudrillard's idea that modern society is increasingly disconnected from ""the real"" (point 8). however, the author questions whether this distancing from authenticity truly matters, stating ""who cares?"" this suggests the author may be ambivalent about overly concerning oneself with divorces from reality."
,,,,,,what is the significance of the references to feminism and feminist theory?,"feminism and feminist perspectives appear to be important to the author, who enthusiastically endorses ""radical feminism"" and ""real equality"" in areas like sexuality, economics, and morality (point 6). the author also highlights sex-positive feminism and women controlling sexual dynamics as forms of ""feminist sexuality"" (point 30)."
,,,,,,how does the author approach interpersonal conflicts and dealing with difficult people?,"the author acknowledges the pervasiveness of pettiness (points 4, 23) and suggests pettiness from others like friends and coworkers can be emotionally damaging (point 17). however, the author also advocates minimizing negativity (point 15) and recognizing underlying reasons why difficult people act that way (point 17 - ""dbags can get to you"" because ""it can be a bit tricky even in its most obviously recognizable forms"")."
,,,,,,what is the significance of the dream descriptions and analysis in the document?,"the author includes several brief descriptions and interpretations of dreams (points 25, 26, 33), suggesting dreams and their symbolic meanings hold some significance. for example, point 25 analyzes a dream of swimming to the statue of liberty in terms of sensory experiences like taste and smell."
,,,,,,"how does the author view the concept of ""the void"" or existential emptiness?","the author seems to acknowledge a sense of existential emptiness or ""void"", stating ""everyone has a void - i.e. - a hole - satisfaction is hard to come by don't feel bad that you feel bad"" (point 22). this suggests the author sees dissatisfaction and a feeling of emptiness as a common part of the human experience."
,,,,,,what is the author's perspective on time and temporal awareness?,"the author appears to place importance on cultivating awareness of the passage of time, encouraging practices like watching clocks/stopwatches (point 29) and ""being intimate with time"" (point 29). the author also suggests experimenting with different perspectives on time (point 30)."
,,,,,,how does the author approach the idea of moral complexity and ethical ambiguity?,"the author implies that achieving worthy goals can sometimes require unethical or ""ugly"" means, stating ""beautiful goal -> ugly way to reach it -> git dirty"" (point 3). this suggests the author sees moral absolutism as too simplistic, and is open to ethical pragmatism when necessary."
,,,,,,what is the significance of the references to philosophy and philosophers?,"the author engages with the ideas of various philosophers like nietzsche, camus, and buddha at multiple points. this indicates the author finds value in philosophical frameworks for analyzing concepts like morality, meaning, mental states, and the human condition. philosophy seems to be an important lens through which the author views the world."
,,,,,,how does the author approach themes of identity and self-expression?,"the idea of embracing one's authentic self and expressing individuality runs throughout the document. the author advocates ""full expression"" (point 2), letting one's ""weirdness come out"" (point 15), and rejecting conformity to a restrictive ""high school mentality"" (point 23). unrestrained self-expression appears to be valued."
,,,,,,"what is the significance of the point about ""maximizing beauty""?","the very first point states ""maximize the beauty - fully channel the beauty with in."" this concept of actively maximizing and channeling beauty, both inward and outward, seems to be a guiding principle or ethic for the author. it's one of the few ideas repeatedly emphasized throughout the wide-ranging ideas in the document."
